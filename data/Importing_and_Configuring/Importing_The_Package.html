<h3>Importing the Package</h3>
<p>
After purchasing the package from the Unity Asset Store you can import the project into a new or existing Unity project. However, we recommend that you purchase the project from within an empty project and then export the clean package. You can then easily import the package into another project -and if you have issues you can always go back to the original version.

<p>
The package contains one script  and some particles in the Standard Assets folder so you'll need to import them as well.Don't worry, none of your standard assets will be overwritten. It was necessary to put MouseLookDB in the Standard Assets folder because of Unity's order of compilation
